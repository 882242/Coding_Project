# Final 

For this final I want to make a better version of my gambling game. Since the old version was in type format...
I want to make a Visual and easy way to play it instead. Since I learned from Tkinter, I can make it into a visual format.

### We would want a code for each button:

`tkinter.Button Gamble`
`tkinter.Button Buy`

### We want a Label for our shops and Balance

`tkinter.Label Balance`
`tkinter.Label Shop`

### And make functions for buttons

`def Gamble
    random.radint (1,10)`
    
`def buy(Product)
    Product = True`
