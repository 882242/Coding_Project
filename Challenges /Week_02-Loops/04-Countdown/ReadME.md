To create a countdown timer with user input being able to stop it
 is new and i will need to experiement with some things

Chat Gpt wants me to give a loop command where it ask every second if it wants to stop
which i'm not doing, so now i will be doing research on how to have 2 inputs at once which
python usually blocks until one input is entered

I ask Ai to create a code, and then i studied it until i finally understand it, I also remembered
the code block by block, and explain in inside the code
